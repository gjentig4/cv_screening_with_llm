#### 2.3 Scoring System
Implement four main scoring components:
1. Technical Skills (0-100)
2. Project Experience (0-100)
3. Problem-Solving (0-100)
4. Growth Potential (0-100)

#### 2.4 LLM Analysis Integration
- Text analysis implementation
- Pattern recognition
- Context understanding
- Scoring logic

### Step 3: Scoring Logic Implementation

#### Score Components
```python
scoring_weights = {
    "technical_skills": {
        "weight": 0.3,
        "components": {
            "python_proficiency": 0.4,
            "ml_frameworks": 0.4,
            "other_skills": 0.2
        }
    },
    "project_experience": {
        "weight": 0.3,
        "components": {
            "complexity": 0.4,
            "relevance": 0.3,
            "impact": 0.3
        }
    },
    "problem_solving": {
        "weight": 0.25,
        "components": {
            "approach": 0.5,
            "implementation": 0.5
        }
    },
    "growth_potential": {
        "weight": 0.15,
        "components": {
            "learning_trajectory": 0.6,
            "adaptability": 0.4
        }
    }
}
```

### Step 4: Output Generation

#### Expected Output Format
```python
candidate_evaluation = {
    "scores": {
        "technical": float,
        "experience": float,
        "problem_solving": float,
        "growth": float
    },
    "overall_fit": float,
    "confidence": float,
    "recommendation": str,
    "analysis": str
}
```

## Implementation Guidelines for Cursor AI

### Code Generation Context
- The system should be modular and extensible
- Each module should have clear input/output specifications
